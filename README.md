# StockTrader
my projects involving stock market and ai analysis

There are 5 main versions of TRAIDE, which was the name of my program.
V1 is a very convoluted deep network and algorithim combo
V2 is more of a mental reset and more organized V1
V3 is my attempt at using an RNN for the first time
V4 uses my custom DNN and RNN that I made from scratch in another project
V5 is mainly just algorithims but also uses interesting persepctivess like vector fields (this works the best)

there are also more specific files dedicated to certain stocks or cryptos, and these are dedicated to swing trading
these develop the vector field idea a bit more and also show the most promise for moving forward
